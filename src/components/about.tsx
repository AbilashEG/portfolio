          Hello! I'm Abilash EG, a passionate and forward-thinking Data Analytics and AI/ML Engineer with a strong foundation in cloud computing, currently focused on building scalable, intelligent systems using AWS technologies. My journey in tech is fueled by a deep curiosity for how data, machine learning, and automation can come together to solve real-world problems. I specialize in designing and deploying data-driven solutions using tools like Amazon SageMaker, Bedrock, Athena, and QuickSight, enabling powerful insights and intelligent decision-making. Whether it's training predictive models, analyzing large datasets, or integrating GenAI into production environments, I strive to deliver impactful results. My work blends the analytical mindset of a data scientist with the practical skills of a cloud engineer and the structure of a DevOps practitioner. From developing full-stack web applications using Flask to enhancing GenAI chatbots with file processing or building a CVE tracker API that fetches real-time security data, I enjoy projects that sit at the intersection of data, automation, and innovation. I'm also deeply interested in cloud cost optimization, secure coding practices, and streamlining workflows through MLOps. I believe in continuous learning through hands-on experimentation and actively keep up with the latest trends in AI, DevOps, and cloud-native development. Outside of my work, youâ€™ll find me exploring new AWS services, building side projects, and staying plugged into the tech community. I'm always open to collaborating on exciting ideas that create real value.
